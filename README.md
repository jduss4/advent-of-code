# Advent of Code

Jessica's pathetic attempt at most of these challenges in Ruby.

## Run

To run today's challenge problems (if it exists):

`ruby adventer.rb`

Specify day in December (and year, optionally):

`ruby adventer.rb [day_of_month] [year]`


## How to make a new day

Structure:

```
year/
  |-- day/
       |-- solution.rb
       |-- test.rb
       |-- input.txt
       |-- output.txt
```
